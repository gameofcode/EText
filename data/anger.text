One night I could not practise my violin as my family was Ã¡ watching T.V with the lights off
When I came back to my hostel
My classmate always borrowed my notes and would not return it to Ã¡ me on time.  When I had a test she was selfish and irresponsible Ã¡ and so delayed my studies.
I gave tutorial to a student and I found that he was lazy
My classmate used her personal relations to get a seat for a Ã¡ subject that I wanted also.  I had taken the pains to help him Ã¡ apply and I did not get selected.  I did not like this as he had Ã¡ not told me the facts earlier
Something was stolen.
My intimate girlfriend told me that her father was opposed to our Ã¡ relationship  and had insulted my integrity.
Someone played a trick on me.
I worked with several classmates on a project.  I was very Ã¡ anxious about the project while my partners showed no concern  Ã¡ and when we had meetings on the project my classmates  did not Ã¡ pay any attention.  Some of them read books while the others Ã¡ argued on irrelevant questions.  The meeting would go on for two Ã¡ hours without the main theme being discussed.  We wasted time and Ã¡ could not reach a compromise.  My classmates avoided doing the Ã¡ work and the responsibilities
My girlfriend disliked it when I played majong (a game of gambling).  Ã¡ I expressed my regrets and when I went to see her she neglected my Ã¡ existance.  I was very angry and left in displeasure.
During a football match
Yesterday I read in the newspaper that a 30 year old woman had Ã¡ abused her 2 month old son and had caused his death.  I was very Ã¡ angry after reading this as this is not a human act and to abuse Ã¡ so fragile a life is not a forgivable sin.
[ Whenever I put myself in other's shoes and try to make the Ã¡ person happy
When I learnt that a friend of mine had talked about me to Ã¡ another friend and had said wrong things about my abilities and Ã¡ attitudes.  I was very angry.
One day
Once my father slapped my mother for a small quarrel.
A female classmate was always late for meetings which were for Ã¡ the homework and not social gatherings.  We were very busy and Ã¡ the deadline was close but we had to waste half an hour or an Ã¡ hour waiting for her as we could do nothing else then.
One day I had sunned my favourite shirt and was putting it back Ã¡ in the wardrobe when my younger brother snatched it from me and Ã¡ wore it.  He had not had a bath and was very dirty.  I scolded him Ã¡ but he answered back and locked himself up in a room.  I was very Ã¡ angry so I starteed kicking on the door and abusing him loudly Ã¡ and freely.
I had a very good friend in secondary school.  The year after our Ã¡ graduation I prepared to celebrate her birthday and I called off Ã¡ all my appointments.  I got together the other friends and we Ã¡ were ready to give the entire day to her.  However this friend Ã¡ disappeared on her birthday.  When I phoned another friend I Ã¡ didcovered thay she was busy
My sister once stole my mother's money and made her very angry.  Ã¡ After this my mother would beat her up for unreasonable reasons.  Ã¡ One day my sister lent her book to a friend without telling my Ã¡ mother about it.  When my mother learnt this she beat her up and Ã¡ even threatened her with a pair of scissors.  
When I was in F4 I played a basket-ball match against another Ã¡ school's team.  One of their team members kicked a team-mate of Ã¡ mine so I kicked him back and we had a fight with each other.
I had a date with my girlfriend
I was a prefect at secondary school.  On the sports day I told Ã¡ others that I would take down the names of the people who Ã¡ misbehaved and after some time I sat down for a brief rest.  Ã¡ Suddenly the head prefect came and scolded me in front of others. Ã¡  I was very angry as there were other prefects sitting and he Ã¡ picked on me.  I thought that a brief rest was not  serious Ã¡ enough to be blamed.
When I got into a bus I found that my wallet had been stolen. Ã¡ It was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I Ã¡ lost some documents - identity papers.  As a result I had to Ã¡ spend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always Ã¡ remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I Ã¡ suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil Ã¡ servant.  I had already had bad luck and they treated me like a Ã¡ criminal.   At one point of time I really wanted to quarrel with Ã¡ them.
The day the results of the Chinese university was announced I Ã¡ should have been very happy; however my grandmother
Last week I had planned to play tennis and had booked a tennis Ã¡ court.   However when I arrived at the university gym the clerk Ã¡ told me that the court was being used for lessons.
My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that Ã¡ he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's Ã¡ house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I Ã¡ felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so Ã¡ he should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is Ã¡ I was in a bad mood then).
We had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the Ã¡ inter-department song contest.  I arrived and found that there Ã¡ was nobody there.  When I went to the canteen I found them eating Ã¡ lunch.  I was so angry that I aired my greviances to one of them Ã¡ and then left.
Whenever my father smokes the smell makes me feel very Ã¡ uncomfortable.  He never listens to my complaints and I curse him Ã¡ furiously in my mind.  I cannot solve this problem by violence Ã¡ because of traditional moral values.  
I came across a girl at the school bus-stop
My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt Ã¡ insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did Ã¡ not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other Ã¡ friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant Ã¡ person.  However I could not apologize
Someone spread rumours about me.
When I saw that my bed at the hostel was a mess I guessed that Ã¡ someone else had used my daily necessities.  I felt that my  personal Ã¡ sanity had been affected.
The surname of my brother was different from ours.  He often Ã¡ grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This Ã¡ made me angry.
In September 1984
Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her Ã¡ grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in Ã¡ mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me Ã¡ and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  Ã¡ When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be Ã¡ employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  Ã¡ there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they Ã¡ made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five Ã¡ days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another Ã¡ child to teach.
